# Fraction And Vector calculator.
**Why Fraction??...bcz Fractions are more precise.**

To solve a problem to its precise result ,I had made a calculator that is more precise in providing result than any other calculator present today.

Suppose we have two repeating decimal number ```2.4333...``` and ```0.323232...```.
> on performing any arithematic operation with normal calculator we will loose the decimal points but my calculator will be providing the most precise and accurate answer.

<b> Under the Features section in select box I had also added other useful operation that can be very useful while playing with fraction , Like.. </b>

```LCM```, ```HCF```,```Maximum```,```Minimum```,```Are Like Fraction```,```Reciporical```. etc..

# Vector Calculator
**Why Vector Calculator??...We being human, forget the procedure and formulas to calculate a particular result, I have aggregated them here as features and will only require the positional coordinate of vectors to get the result.**
* this will save the time of calculation.
* One will be more confident of its accuracy.
* One can focus on main task leaving these hard calculation.

<b> Under the Features section in select box these are the features that I have added.. </b>
```Magnitude```,```Direction Cosine```,```Angle With x```,```Angle with y```,```Angle With z```,```Unit Vector Direction```,```Dot Product```,```Cross Product```,```Addition```,```Projection```,```Collinear```,```Angle Between Vectors```,```Check Perpendicular```,etc..
